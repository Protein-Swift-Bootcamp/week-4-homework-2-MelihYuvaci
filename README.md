# week-4-homework-2

## Summary

The Covid-19 application shows the statistics of countries around the world in total and on which dates. Data was taken from 3 different endpoints with the project MVC design pattern. There are 4 different views with the main page. Each view has separate manager classes from which data is received and sent. The transitions between the pages were made with a present, and at the same time, the data was transferred from page to page with the protocol we learned from the previous week. As desired, you can see the table view in the section where the countries are listed with a custom cell and you can see that there is an activity indicator on each page. Have fun :)

Note: If the application crashes in the statistics section, it is because the data of that country is empty. It's not about me, it's about the API. I present to your information
